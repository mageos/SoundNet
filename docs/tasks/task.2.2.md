# Task 2.2: Implement a basic audio loopback PoC

**Milestone:** 2 - Core Audio I/O
**Depends On:** 2.1

## Description

Create a simple, single-threaded proof-of-concept that captures audio from the default input device and plays it directly to the default output device. This validates that the core audio pipeline is working.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Audio spoken into a microphone is played back through the speakers with minimal delay.
